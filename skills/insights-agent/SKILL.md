# Insights Agent

**Wiki root:** `/home/ty/Documents/LLM-WIKI`  
**Synapse MCP server:** project-synapse-mcp at `/home/ty/Repositories/ai_workspace/project-synapse-mcp`

## Bootstrap

1. Read this skill file (you just did)
2. Read your agent sheet: `wiki/scratchpad/agent-sheets/insights.md`
3. Execute the workflow per the agent sheet

## MCP Tools — Availability Check Required

**CRITICAL:** `synapse_mcp` is installed in the project-synapse-mcp venv, NOT the hermes-agent venv. Cron runs under hermes-agent's python.

**MCP availability check — use this path:**
```bash
/home/ty/Repositories/ai_workspace/project-synapse-mcp/.venv/bin/python3 -c "from synapse_mcp.zettelkasten.insight_engine import InsightEngine; print('OK')" 2>/dev/null && echo "MCP OK" || echo "MCP UNAVAILABLE"
```

If MCP is available, use `debug_test` to confirm, then proceed.

## Task: Run insight generation, integrate into wiki

### Phase 1: Generate

Run the CLI via `timeout` wrapper (NOT the MCP tool — it times out at 300s):

**CRITICAL:** Use the shell `timeout` wrapper as the outermost layer. Defense-in-depth:
- Shell `timeout` (580s SIGTERM, 590s SIGKILL) — outermost
- App `--max-runtime 540` — soft cap via `asyncio.wait_for`
- App SIGALRM watchdog at `max_runtime + 30s` — hard cap for blocking numpy/networkx

```bash
cd /home/ty/Repositories/ai_workspace/project-synapse-mcp && \
    timeout --kill-after=10s 580s uv run python scripts/generate_insights.py \
    --topic general --print --max-runtime 540 2>&1
```

Exit codes: 0 = success, 3 = timeout exceeded (file may still be valid), 1 = init failure.

**Exit code 3 is expected and not a failure.** The hard watchdog fires at 570s when the LLM synthesis phase takes longer than the soft cap. The output files (`latest.md`, `latest.json`) are written incrementally and are valid. Proceed to Phase 2 immediately — do not re-run.

This takes ~10 minutes on a healthy run.

### Phase 2: Read results

After completion, read both output files to understand what was generated.

### Phase 3: Integrate insights into wiki

For each insight with `confidence >= 0.7`:

1. Create synthesis page at `wiki/synthesis/insights/<slug>.md`
2. Frontmatter: created, updated, type=synthesis, summary (one-line from title), tags=[insights, zettelkasten, <topic>], sources=[derived from evidence], status=active, confidence
3. Body: title (## heading), content paragraph, evidence section

Slug mapping: Insight Title → `lower-hyphen-insight`, e.g. `Titans Memory Architecture` → `titans-memory-efficiency-insight`

### Phase 4: Index

**Cron environment note:** MCP tools (`wiki_update_index()`, `synapse_remember()`) are unavailable in a cron context because the Synapse MCP server runs in the project-synapse-mcp venv, not hermes-agent's python. Do NOT attempt to call them — they will fail or hang.

Workaround: After creating pages:
1. Verify pages exist on disk (`ls wiki/synthesis/insights/`)
2. Record open items in carryover for manual follow-up in an active MCP session

### Phase 5: Episodic memory

**Deferred in cron.** Cannot call `synapse_remember()` — MCP context unavailable. After pages are created, add to carryover:

```
### Open
- Run wiki_update_index() + synapse_remember() for N new insight pages (in active MCP session)
```

The episodic memory recording must be done manually or by a follow-up agent running in an active MCP session.

## Key Paths

```
Insight output:  /home/ty/Repositories/ai_workspace/project-synapse-mcp/data/insights/latest.md
JSON data:      /home/ty/Repositories/ai_workspace/project-synapse-mcp/data/insights/latest.json
Insight pages:  /home/ty/Documents/LLM-WIKI/wiki/synthesis/insights/
Agent sheet:     wiki/scratchpad/agent-sheets/insights.md
Carryover:      wiki/scratchpad/jobs/reports/insights/carryover.md
```

## Delivery Rules

- No insights generated or all below threshold 0.7: `[SILENT]`
- 1+ pages created: brief summary → deliver to origin
- CLI failure: report what failed and carry open items to next cycle

## STEP 7 — Kanban Review (Self-Answer Open Questions)

After writing your carryover, load the `kanban-morning-review` skill:

1. Read your carryover at `wiki/scratchpad/jobs/reports/insights/carryover.md`
2. For each item in the **Open** section, attempt to answer it from available context:
   - Search wiki via `search_files` or `mcp_project_synapse_wiki_search` for existing content on the topic
   - Check other carryovers for related filled concepts
   - Use `mcp_project_synapse_synapse_recall` for relevant episodic facts
3. If the answer exists → write it directly to the carryover under "Resolved this cycle" (do NOT create a kanban task)
4. If genuinely unanswerable → use `hermes kanban add` to create the task (the skill handles this)
5. Patch carryover to remove any items that are now resolved

## Confidence Threshold

Only create pages for insights with `confidence >= 0.7`. Lower-confidence insights should be noted in carryover but not integrated as pages.
